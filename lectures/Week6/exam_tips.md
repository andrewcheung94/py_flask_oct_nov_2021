## Adminstrative details
- **Eligibility requirement:** MUST have 90% or higher - in this case, at least 15 out of 16 - core assignments completed and submitted to the platform
- Different colored belts possible:
    - An **orange belt** is earned if you get all the required features built, and you submit the exam to the platform within 24 hours.
    - A **red belt** is the same as the orange belt, but you finish it within 5 hours.
    - A **black belt** required additional advanced features in addition to the main ones for the orange/red belt, AND you deploy your site publicly through AWS (or a similar host) within 24 hours after you submit to the platform.  *Email me the link to your public site so that I can examine and grade it.*
    -  You keep the highest belt you earn, so if you get an orange/red and want to aim for a higher belt, you may!  If you do try for a higher belt and fail, don't worry - you still keep the original (highest) belt.
- **You get 3 attempts.**  The last attempt must be unlocked by 11:59 PM Pacific on Wednesday, November 17.
- Other important notes:
    - You are NOT allowed to talk with other people - students, instructors or TAs (or anyone similar) - to receive help or ask for how to implement a specific feature.  You are allowed to use the platform and other resources online during the test - but don't converse with anybody about the exam at all - including afterwards.
    - You may only reach out if you need clarification or if a problem arises, e.g. can't submit exam, code doesn't work - in these cases, email me IMMEDIATELY.  You still have to submit the exam within the 5- or 24-hour timeframe through the platform; email it to me if you are unable to send - still within the timeframe.
    - **DON'T PLAGIARIZE!!!!**  You will be caught very easily.
- Exams should be graded within 48 hours (slightly longer if taken during the weekend).  If you don't hear back, let me know at once.

## Pre-exam tips:
- Have a working login/registration beforehand.
- Have the folders and at least a few files ready to go beforehand.
- Have your schema ready at least for the login/registration beforehand.
- Get some sleep the night before!
- Make sure you're hydrated and eat appropriately.
- Don't cram too much the night before; burnout will be a problem.

## Tips while taking the exam:
- Take screenshots of the exam prompt in case your internet or the platform crashes.
- Decide whether to go for orange/red belt or black belt early on.  You will see two wireframes, both similar, but the black belt is more difficult.
- Test your project *a lot*!  For example, with login/registration, test validations.  Say you try to log in with a correct email but wrong password, or even an email that doesn't exist when logging in.  
- Examine your queries in MySQL Workbench!  Test them out and see what output you get, if anything.  Oftentimes the issue is along the lines of "cannot iterate a boolean" or something similar.  Also check the output in the terminal!
- Make a checklist of features, and cross off each one you finish!
- Don't forget the 20-minute rule (without other people) - use Google, platform, etc.

## When you're finished with the exam:
- Send a zipped copy of your project folder!  So it'll include the app, server, etc.  *Make sure it has the Pipfile and Pipfile.lock files!*
- **IMPORTANT: Include the model file (the one with the .mwb extension).**  Don't send a screenshot - it has to be the actual file.

## After the exam:

- If you don't pass, don't be discouraged!  Many need more than 1 attempt to earn a belt.
- If you want to talk about the exam afterwards, feel free to book a one-on-one appointment.  Slots will fill quickly!
- If you pass the exam, **congratulations!**  
- **WARNING: Just because you pass the test does NOT mean you've passed the course yet.**  You still have discussion topics to complete, and possibly core assignments.  There are 3 components to pass the class:
    - Earn a belt through an exam
    - Complete 80% or more of discussions - in this case, at least 13 out of 16
    - Complete 90% or more of core assignments - in the stack, at least 15 out of 16; this should already be satisfied when you take the exam, but this is a reminder just in case. 
- Once you've met all the requirements to pass the course, what you can do depends on the next stack:
    - If you are heading to Projects & Algorithms (P&A) next:
        - Start brainstorming ideas for your solo project.  Think of a list of features your site will have, and build a wireframe through https://balsamiq.com/ (most often used) or https://wireframe.cc.  (A wireframe is a visual mockup of your site.)  Don't take on too much at once with your project - try to have a small list of like 3 features or so that you need!
        - I also *highly* advise you to brush up on your JavaScript skills since we'll use JS in that stack for your algorithms.
    - If you're heading to Java or MERN: start working on a small project to keep your Python, Flask and MySQL skills fresh.
